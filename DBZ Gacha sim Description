This is a simple, command-line based gacha game simulator set in the universe of Dragon Ball Z. Designed for quick and randomized pulls, it lets players experience the thrill of "rolling" 
for iconic DBZ characters across different rarity tiers. The simulator is built around a tiered rarity system that categorizes iconic Dragon Ball Z characters into 
four distinct levels: Common, Rare, Super, and Ultra. Each tier has a predetermined probability of being pulled, creating a clear hierarchy of desirability. The Common Pool, with a 50% chance,
the Rare Pool has a 30% chance, the Super Pool, with a 16% chance, and lastly the Ultra Pool, with a mere 4% chance. Players are provided with multiple interactive pull options to engage with the gacha system. 
The "(S)ingle Pull" option allows for a single, individual gacha roll. For those seeking a larger haul, the "(T)en Pull" executes ten consecutive single pulls, presenting a batch of results. 
Additionally, the simulator includes a "(P)ity Pull" feature, which significantly boosts the odds for rarer characters.
